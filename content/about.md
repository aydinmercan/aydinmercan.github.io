title: About
---

I am Aydin Mercan (`/ˈaɪdɪn merdʒan/`), a sophomore CEng student at TOBB ETU. I am interested in security, cryptography and
hardware description but I aim to share knowledge I stumble on from a broad of topics includings interests such as mathematics.

# Name

I have several legal variations of my name depending on where you ask me. However, Jaiden with any pronoun is fine by me.
