#+TITLE: About

I am Aydin Mercan (=/ˈaɪdɪn merdʒan/=), a sophomore CEng student at TOBB ETU. I am interested in security, cryptography and
hardware description but I aim to share knowledge I stumble on from a broad of topics includings interests such as mathematics.

* Gear

Currently, I work on a Thinkpad E495 or my desktop. Those systems run Arch Linux since most sane distributions more or less work
with similar toolchains.

* Name

I have several legal variations of my name depending on where you ask me. However, Jaiden with any pronoun is fine by me.
