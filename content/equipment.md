# Everyday Software

* **[Tarsnap][tarsnap]**
* **[Wireguard][wireguard]**
    * They just work. Can recommend.

* **[Binary Ninja][binja]**
    * Personally my favourite reverse engineering/analysis software.

* **[KiCad][kicad], [Godot][godot], [Ardour][ardour], [Blender][blender] and [Krita][krita]**
    * I am not a professional in these areas so I just use powerful but open software that does the job for me.

# Hardware

## Computing

* **Desktop**
    * It currently rocks an i7-4790 with a NVIDIA GTX 960.
    * Currently it runs [Arch](https://archlinux.org).

* **Thinkpad E495**
    * Currently it runs [Fedora 34 Beta](https://getfedora.org).

* **Thinkpad X220**
    * Currently it runs [FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE](https://www.freebsd.org).


## FPGA
* **Basys 3 (Artix-7)**

# Future Plans

## Desktop Upgrade

* A proper CPU and GPU. Doesn't matter which it is but AMD seems good these days.
* [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/)
* [Astrolokeys](https://astrolokeys.com/)

## More FPGAs

* Ideally it shoul mostly work with the yosys + nextpnr workflow.
